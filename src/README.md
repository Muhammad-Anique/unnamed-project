# Source Code Directory

This directory will contain the main source code for the application once the tech stack is determined.

## Planned Structure (pending PRD)

```
src/
├── components/         # Reusable UI components
├── pages/             # Application pages/routes
├── api/               # API route handlers
├── lib/               # Utility functions and configurations
├── types/             # TypeScript type definitions
├── hooks/             # Custom React hooks (if React-based)
├── context/           # React context providers (if React-based)
├── services/          # External service integrations
├── utils/             # Helper utilities
├── constants/         # Application constants
└── styles/            # Global styles and themes

## Notes

- Final structure will depend on chosen framework (Next.js, React, Vue, etc.)

- Each subdirectory will have its own README with specific guidelines
