# Technical Architecture

This directory will contain the comprehensive technical architecture once the PRD is provided.

## Architecture Components (Planned)

### 1. System Architecture
- High-level system design
- Component relationships
- Data flow diagrams
- Service architecture

### 2. Technology Stack
- Frontend framework selection
- Backend technology choices
- Database selection and design
- Infrastructure decisions

### 3. Security Architecture
- Authentication and authorization
- Data protection strategies
- API security measures
- Infrastructure security

### 4. Performance Architecture
- Scalability considerations
- Caching strategies
- Load balancing design
- Performance optimization

### 5. Integration Architecture
- Third-party service integrations
- API design patterns
- Event-driven architecture (if applicable)
- Microservices design (if applicable)

## Current Status
🎯 **Awaiting PRD** - Architecture design depends on project requirements

## Methodology
Our architecture design process:
1. **Requirements Analysis** - Analyze PRD for functional and non-functional requirements
2. **Tech Stack Evaluation** - Select appropriate technologies based on requirements
3. **System Design** - Create high-level and detailed system architecture
4. **Security Design** - Plan security measures and compliance requirements
5. **Performance Planning** - Design for scalability and performance
6. **Documentation** - Create comprehensive technical documentation

## Architecture Principles
- **Scalability** - Design for growth and load handling
- **Security** - Security by design approach
- **Maintainability** - Clean, modular, and well-documented code
- **Performance** - Efficient and optimized solutions
- **Reliability** - Robust error handling and fault tolerance
- **Cost-Effectiveness** - Balanced solution considering development and operational costs
