## 🎯 Immediate Next Steps

1. **PRD Submission** 📋
   - Provide Product Requirements Document
   - Share Google Docs URL or create `docs/PRD.md`

2. **Requirements Review** 🔍
   - Analyze functional requirements
   - Identify technical constraints
   - Clarify performance needs

3. **Architecture Design** 🏗️
   - Create system architecture diagrams
   - Design database schema
   - Plan API structure

## 📈 Progress Metrics

| Metric | Current | Target | Status |
|--------|---------|---------|---------|
| Repository Setup | 100% | 100% | ✅ Complete |
| Documentation | 85% | 100% | 🟡 Nearly Complete |
| PRD Analysis | 0% | 100% | 🔴 Blocked |
| Technical Design | 0% | 100% | 🔴 Blocked |
| Implementation | 0% | 100% | 🔴 Blocked |

## 🚧 Blockers

1. **Missing PRD** - Cannot proceed with architecture without requirements
2. **Tech Stack Unknown** - Dependent on application type and requirements
3. **Deployment Target** - Needs to be determined based on scale requirements

## 📅 Timeline Estimate

Once PRD is provided:

| Phase | Estimated Duration | Deliverables |
|-------|-------------------|--------------|
| Requirements Analysis | 1-2 days | Technical requirements doc |
| Architecture Design | 2-3 days | System architecture, DB design |
| Tech Stack Setup | 1-2 days | Development environment |
| Initial Implementation | 3-5 days | Basic functionality |

**Total Estimated Time:** 7-12 days from PRD to MVP
