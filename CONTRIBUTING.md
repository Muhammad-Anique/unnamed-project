- **User Requirements**: Target users and user stories
- **Business Logic**: Important business rules and workflows
- **Performance Requirements**: Expected load and performance needs
- **Integration Requirements**: Third-party services and APIs needed
- **Security Requirements**: Compliance and security needs

### 2. Code Contributions (After Architecture is Complete)

#### Development Workflow
1. Fork the repository
2. Create a feature branch (`git checkout -b feature/amazing-feature`)
3. Make your changes
4. Add tests for your changes
5. Ensure all tests pass
6. Commit your changes (`git commit -m 'feat: add amazing feature'`)
7. Push to the branch (`git push origin feature/amazing-feature`)

## Code Review Process
1. All changes require pull request reviews
2. At least one approval required before merging
3. All tests must pass
4. Code must follow established conventions
5. Documentation must be updated if needed

## Issue Reporting
When reporting issues:
1. Use the issue templates
2. Provide clear reproduction steps
3. Include relevant environment information
