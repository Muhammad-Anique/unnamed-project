# Unnamed Project

## Overview
This repository is set up for creating a comprehensive technical architecture. Currently awaiting the Product Requirements Document (PRD) to design the complete architecture.

## Project Status
🔍 **Awaiting PRD** - Need Product Requirements Document to proceed with architecture design

## What We Need

To create a proper technical architecture, please provide:

1. **PRD Document URL or Content** with:
   - Application purpose and functionality
   - Key features and requirements
   - User requirements and personas
   - Business logic specifications
   - Performance requirements
   - Integration needs
   - Security requirements

2. **Or at minimum, provide**:
   - What type of application this is
   - Core features it needs
   - Target users
   - Key functionality requirements

## Once PRD is Available

We will create a comprehensive technical architecture including:

- ✅ Tech stack selection and justification
- ✅ System architecture diagrams
- ✅ Database schema design
- ✅ API specifications
- ✅ Security considerations
- ✅ Deployment strategy
- ✅ Development workflow
- ✅ Testing strategy

```

## Getting Started

1. **Provide PRD**: Share the Product Requirements Document
2. **Architecture Design**: We'll create detailed technical architecture
3. **Tech Stack Selection**: Choose appropriate technologies
4. **Implementation Plan**: Create development roadmap
